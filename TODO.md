### Done âœ“

- [x] Add bounding box computation for regions of interest in the image.
- [x] Implement logic to transition between stand still/left/right motion as well as crouch/upright position.
- [x] Test the command API general functionality.
- [x] Add optical flow computation for use in instant action detection algorithm.
- [x] Test the command API with actual in game key presses.
- [x] Implement algorithm to identify instant actions based on optical flow in regions of interest.
- [x] Replace the noisy segmentation with head detection - we can use the location of the head as
